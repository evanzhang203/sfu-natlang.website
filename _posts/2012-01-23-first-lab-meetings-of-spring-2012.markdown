The first three lab meetings of Spring were for paper review and planning. On January 4 we reviewed short papers for submission to NAACL 2012. On January 11 we reviewed long papers for submission to ACL 2012. On January 18 we did an update on paper submissions and research plans. For the rest of the semester we will be continuing with having one person speak at each meeting.
