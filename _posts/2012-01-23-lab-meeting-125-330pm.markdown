The next lab meeting will be on Wednesday January 25, 2012 at 3:30pm, in TASC1 9408.






Max Whitney will be talking about recent research:


> Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set of seed rules can be viewed as the propagation of labels between examples via features shared between them. We introduce a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets.
