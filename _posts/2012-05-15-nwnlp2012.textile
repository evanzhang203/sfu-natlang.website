We had several items at the Pacific Northwest Regional NLP Workshop this year.

Test one:

@proceedings{whitney-sarkar:2012,
	author = {Whitney, Max and Sarkar, Anoop},
	title = {Bootstrapping via Graph Propagation},
	year = {2012},
	publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},
	pdf = {http://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~mwhitney/personal/yarowsky-propagation.pdf},
	abstract = {{Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set of seed rules can be viewed as the propagation of labels between examples via features shared between them. This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets.}}
