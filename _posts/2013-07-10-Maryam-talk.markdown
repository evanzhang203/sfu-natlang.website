title: Path Ranking Algorithm
---

In the next lab meeting on July 10, Maryam Siahbani is going to talk about "Path Ranking Algorithm" (PRA) and some application of this method. PRA uses random walks to generate relational features on graph data, and combine them with a logistic regression model. This approach has been used to solve efficiency issue of relational retrieval and relational learning in real-world applications with large-scale data( e.g inference task in a large knowledge base )

The original paper is <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nlao/publication/2010/2010.ML.PRA.pdf">Relational Retrieval using a combination of path-constrained random walks</a>. 

There have been two papers on its application as well. 

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nlao/publication/2011/2011.emnlp.paper.pdf">Random Walk Inference and Learning in A Large Scale Knowledge Base</a>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nlao/publication/2012/2012.emnlp.paper.pdf">Reading The Web with Learned Syntactic-Semantic Inference Rules</a>

The lab meeting will start at 1230 hours at TASC1 9408.
