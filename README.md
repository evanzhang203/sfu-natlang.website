New SFU natlang site with Jekyll and Bootstrap.

Dependencies
============

Tested with ruby 2.1.1 and jekyll 1.5.1

- unicode
- nokogiri
- RedCloth
- rdiscount
- bibtex-ruby
- citeproc-ruby
- csl-styles
- jekyll

All of the above can be installed from ruby gems. 

They are already installed for the natlang ruby module, so there is no need for any setup besides loading the one module.
